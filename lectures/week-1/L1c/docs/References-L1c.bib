	abstract = {Clustering genes based on their expression profiles is usually the first step in geneexpression data analysis. Among the many algorithms that can be applied to gene clustering, the k-means algorithm is one of the most popular techniques. This is mainly due to its ease of comprehension, implementation, and interpretation of the results. However, k-means suffers from some problems, such as the need to define a priori the number of clusters (k) and the possibility of getting trapped into local optimal solutions. Evolutionary algorithms for clustering, by contrast, are known for being capable of performing broad searches over the space of possible solutions and can be used to automatically estimate the number of clusters. This work elaborates on an evolutionary algorithm specially designed to solve clustering problems and shows how it can be used to optimize the k-means algorithm. The performance of the resultant hybrid approach is illustrated by means of experiments in several bioinformatics datasets with multiple measurements, which are expected to yield more accurate and more stable clusters. Two different measures (Euclidean and Pearson) are employed for computing (dis)similarities between genes. A review of the use of evolutionary algorithms for gene-expression data processing is also included. Key words: Evolutionary algorithms, k-means algorithm, Clustering, Bioinformatics.},

	abstract = {Customers have always been and always will be the center of the market and its most important element. As time goes on, it becomes increasingly clear how different types of customers affect market and product strategies as a whole, thanks in large part to the wealth of data that is now readily available. Most people prefer online purchasing, especially after the pandemic, which has helped boost data about the customers, their preferences, and their traits and has consequently helped firms understand their demands better. One of the methods to better provide for consumers is by implementing customer segmentation. Customer segmentation is the approach via which we may construct groups of clients depending on different elements from their already obtained data, this might be based on gender, area, age, etc. Practicing client segmentation helps the organization understand its prospective audience better which in return helps it produce better marketing schemes targeting certain zones which may assist in enhancing its product growth. Here we have developed customer segmentation bearing in mind the above-mentioned trinketed attempt to turn a system that can help predict the items that the client might be eager to buy using K-means clustering. To develop the system, we have utilized the K-means algorithm using Python language with the support of Machine Learning and Data Science methodologies. The data set used here provides real-time data about products brought along with other important information.},

@article{Wu:2008aa,
	abstract = {The traditional (unweighted) k-means is one of the most popular clustering methods for analyzing gene expression data. However, it suffers three major shortcomings. It is sensitive to initial partitions, its result is prone to the local minima, and it is only applicable to data with spherical-shape clusters. The last shortcoming means that we must assume that gene expression data at the different conditions follow the independent distribution with the same variances. Nevertheless, this assumption is not true in practice.},

@article{Hadipour:2022aa,
	abstract = {Converting molecules into computer-interpretable features with rich molecular information is a core problem of data-driven machine learning applications in chemical and drug-related tasks. Generally speaking, there are global and local features to represent a given molecule. As most algorithms have been developed based on one type of feature, a remaining bottleneck is to combine both feature sets for advanced molecule-based machine learning analysis. Here, we explored a novel analytical framework to make embeddings of the molecular features and apply them in the clustering of a large number of small molecules.},

@article{Kohonen:1982aa,
	abstract = {This work contains a theoretical study and computer simulations of a new self-organizing process. The principal discovery is that in a simple network of adaptive physical elements which receives signals from a primary event space, the signal representations are automatically mapped onto a set of output responses in such a way that the responses acquire the same topological order as that of the primary events. In other words, a principle has been discovered which facilitates the automatic formation of topologically correct maps of features of observable events. The basic self-organizing system is a one- or two-dimensional array of processing units resembling a network of threshold-logic units, and characterized by short-range lateral feedback between neighbouring units. Several types of computer simulations are used to demonstrate the ordering process as well as the conditions under which it fails.},
