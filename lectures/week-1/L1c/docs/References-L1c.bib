	abstract = {The K-means algorithm is one of the most popular clustering algorithms in current use as it is relatively fast yet simple to understand and deploy in practice. Nevertheless, its use entails certain restrictive assumptions about the data, the negative consequences of which are not always immediately apparent, as we demonstrate. While more flexible algorithms have been developed, their widespread use has been hindered by their computational and technical complexity. Motivated by these considerations, we present a flexible alternative to K-means that relaxes most of the assumptions, whilst remaining almost as fast and simple. This novel algorithm which we call MAP-DP (maximum a-posteriori Dirichlet process mixtures), is statistically rigorous as it is based on nonparametric Bayesian Dirichlet process mixture modeling. This approach allows us to overcome most of the limitations imposed by K-means. The number of clusters K is estimated from the data instead of being fixed a-priori as in K-means. In addition, while K-means is restricted to continuous data, the MAP-DP framework can be applied to many kinds of data, for example, binary, count or ordinal data. Also, it can efficiently separate outliers from the data. This additional flexibility does not incur a significant computational overhead compared to K-means with MAP-DP convergence typically achieved in the order of seconds for many practical problems. Finally, in contrast to K-means, since the algorithm is based on an underlying statistical model, the MAP-DP framework can deal with missing data and enables model testing such as cross validation in a principled way. We demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of this algorithm on the health informatics problem of clinical sub-typing in a cluster of diseases known as parkinsonism.},

@article{Peng:2007,
	abstract = { One of the fundamental clustering problems is to assign n points into k clusters based on minimal sum‐of‐squared distances (MSSC), which is known to be NP‐hard. In this paper, by using matrix arguments, we first model MSSC as a so‐called 0‐1 semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. We show that our 0‐1 SDP model provides a unified framework for several clustering approaches such as normalized k‐cut and spectral clustering. Moreover, the 0‐1 SDP model allows us to solve the underlying problem approximately via the linear programming and SDP relaxations. Second, we consider the issue of how to extract a feasible solution of the original 0‐1 SDP model from the optimal solution of the relaxed SDP problem. By using principal component analysis, we develop a rounding procedure to construct a feasible partitioning from a solution of the relaxed problem. In our rounding procedure, we need to solve a K‐means clustering problem in \$\Re^{k-1}\$, which can be done in \$O(n^{k^2-2k+2})\$ time. In case of biclustering, the running time of our rounding procedure can be reduced to \$O(n\log n)\$. We show that our algorithm provides a 2--approximate solution to the original problem. Promising numerical results for biclustering based on our new method are reported. },

@article{Alter2006,
	abstract = {We describe the singular value decomposition (SVD) of yeast genome-scale mRNA lengths distribution data measured by DNA microarrays. SVD uncovers in the mRNA abundance levels data matrix of genes × arrays, i.e., electrophoretic gel migration lengths or mRNA lengths, mathematically unique decorrelated and decoupled ``eigengenes.'' The eigengenes are the eigenvectors of the arrays × arrays correlation matrix, with the corresponding series of eigenvalues proportional to the series of the ``fractions of eigen abundance.'' Each fraction of eigen abundance indicates the significance of the corresponding eigengene relative to all others. We show that the eigengenes fit ``asymmetric Hermite functions,'' a generalization of the eigenfunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator and the integral transform which kernel is a generalized coherent state. The fractions of eigen abundance fit a geometric series as do the eigenvalues of the integral transform which kernel is a generalized coherent state. The ``asymmetric generalized coherent state'' models the measured data, where the profiles of mRNA abundance levels of most genes as well as the distribution of the peaks of these profiles fit asymmetric Gaussians. We hypothesize that the asymmetry in the distribution of the peaks of the profiles is due to two competing evolutionary forces. We show that the asymmetry in the profiles of the genes might be due to a previously unknown asymmetry in the gel electrophoresis thermal broadening of a moving, rather than a stationary, band of RNA molecules.},

@inbook{Hruschka2007,
	abstract = {Clustering genes based on their expression profiles is usually the first step in geneexpression data analysis. Among the many algorithms that can be applied to gene clustering, the k-means algorithm is one of the most popular techniques. This is mainly due to its ease of comprehension, implementation, and interpretation of the results. However, k-means suffers from some problems, such as the need to define a priori the number of clusters (k) and the possibility of getting trapped into local optimal solutions. Evolutionary algorithms for clustering, by contrast, are known for being capable of performing broad searches over the space of possible solutions and can be used to automatically estimate the number of clusters. This work elaborates on an evolutionary algorithm specially designed to solve clustering problems and shows how it can be used to optimize the k-means algorithm. The performance of the resultant hybrid approach is illustrated by means of experiments in several bioinformatics datasets with multiple measurements, which are expected to yield more accurate and more stable clusters. Two different measures (Euclidean and Pearson) are employed for computing (dis)similarities between genes. A review of the use of evolutionary algorithms for gene-expression data processing is also included. Key words: Evolutionary algorithms, k-means algorithm, Clustering, Bioinformatics.},

	abstract = {Customers have always been and always will be the center of the market and its most important element. As time goes on, it becomes increasingly clear how different types of customers affect market and product strategies as a whole, thanks in large part to the wealth of data that is now readily available. Most people prefer online purchasing, especially after the pandemic, which has helped boost data about the customers, their preferences, and their traits and has consequently helped firms understand their demands better. One of the methods to better provide for consumers is by implementing customer segmentation. Customer segmentation is the approach via which we may construct groups of clients depending on different elements from their already obtained data, this might be based on gender, area, age, etc. Practicing client segmentation helps the organization understand its prospective audience better which in return helps it produce better marketing schemes targeting certain zones which may assist in enhancing its product growth. Here we have developed customer segmentation bearing in mind the above-mentioned trinketed attempt to turn a system that can help predict the items that the client might be eager to buy using K-means clustering. To develop the system, we have utilized the K-means algorithm using Python language with the support of Machine Learning and Data Science methodologies. The data set used here provides real-time data about products brought along with other important information.},

@article{Wu:2008aa,
	abstract = {The traditional (unweighted) k-means is one of the most popular clustering methods for analyzing gene expression data. However, it suffers three major shortcomings. It is sensitive to initial partitions, its result is prone to the local minima, and it is only applicable to data with spherical-shape clusters. The last shortcoming means that we must assume that gene expression data at the different conditions follow the independent distribution with the same variances. Nevertheless, this assumption is not true in practice.},

@article{Kohonen:1982aa,
	abstract = {This work contains a theoretical study and computer simulations of a new self-organizing process. The principal discovery is that in a simple network of adaptive physical elements which receives signals from a primary event space, the signal representations are automatically mapped onto a set of output responses in such a way that the responses acquire the same topological order as that of the primary events. In other words, a principle has been discovered which facilitates the automatic formation of topologically correct maps of features of observable events. The basic self-organizing system is a one- or two-dimensional array of processing units resembling a network of threshold-logic units, and characterized by short-range lateral feedback between neighbouring units. Several types of computer simulations are used to demonstrate the ordering process as well as the conditions under which it fails.},
