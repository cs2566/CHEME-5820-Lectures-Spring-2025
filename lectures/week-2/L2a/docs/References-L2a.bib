@article{Brezinski:2006,
	abstract = { An important problem in Web search is determining the importance of each page. After introducing the main characteristics of this problem, we will see that, from the mathematical point of view, it could be solved by computing the left principal eigenvector (the PageRank vector) of a matrix related to the structure of the Web by using the power method. We will give expressions of the PageRank vector and study the mathematical properties of the power method. Various Pad{\'e}‐style approximations of the PageRank vector will be given. Since the convergence of the power method is slow, it has to be accelerated. This problem will be discussed. Recently, several acceleration methods were proposed. We will give a theoretical justification for these methods. In particular, we will generalize the recently proposed Quadratic Extrapolation, and we interpret it on the basis of the method of moments of Vorobyev, and as a Krylov subspace method. Acceleration results are given for the various ε‐algorithms, and for the E‐algorithm. Other algorithms for this problem are also discussed. },

@article{Francis-QR-1962,
	abstract = {The QR transformation is an analogue to the LR transformation (Rutishauser, 1958) based on unitary transformations. Both these transformations are global iterative methods for finding the eigenvalues of a matrix, the matrix converging in general to triangular form. In Par t1 of this paper the QR transformation was briefly described and we were then principally concerned with proving convergence, the main result being expressed in theorem 3. We also showed that if the matrix is first reduced to almost triangular form important advantages are gained (further advantages will become apparent) and we gave in outline a way in which convergence could be improved. In this part of the paper we consider the practical application of the QR transformation. Two versions of the algorithm have been programmed for the Pegasus computer; these are described and an attempt is made to evaluate the method. Some results and detailed algorithms are given in appendices. Part 1 was published on pp. 265--71 of this volume (Oct. 61).},

@article{Francis-QR-1961,
	abstract = {The LR transformation, due to Rutishauser, has proved to be a powerful method for finding the eigenvalues of symmetric band matrices. Little attention, however, has been paid to its application to the more difficult problem of finding eigenvalues of general unsymmetric matrices. If the matrices are large two important difficulties are likely to occur. Firstly, triangular decomposition, which is the basis of the method, is by no means always numerically stable, and secondly, the amount of computation required by the method is likely to be very great. This paper describes an algorithm similar to the LR transformation except that the transformations involved in it are all unitary and can thus be expected to by numerically stable. It is then shown that there are various advantages in first converting the matrix to almost-triangular form; in particular, the amount of work involved in the algorithm can then be greatly reduced.Part 1 of the paper is largely concerned with proof of convergence, and the theoretical aspect. Part 2, to be published in January, discussed practical computation and gives results of experiments.},
