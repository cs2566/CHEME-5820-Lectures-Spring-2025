@article{Alter:2006,
	abstract = {We describe the singular value decomposition (SVD) of yeast genome-scale mRNA lengths distribution data measured by DNA microarrays. SVD uncovers in the mRNA abundance levels data matrix of genes × arrays, i.e., electrophoretic gel migration lengths or mRNA lengths, mathematically unique decorrelated and decoupled ``eigengenes.'' The eigengenes are the eigenvectors of the arrays × arrays correlation matrix, with the corresponding series of eigenvalues proportional to the series of the ``fractions of eigen abundance.'' Each fraction of eigen abundance indicates the significance of the corresponding eigengene relative to all others. We show that the eigengenes fit ``asymmetric Hermite functions,'' a generalization of the eigenfunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator and the integral transform which kernel is a generalized coherent state. The fractions of eigen abundance fit a geometric series as do the eigenvalues of the integral transform which kernel is a generalized coherent state. The ``asymmetric generalized coherent state'' models the measured data, where the profiles of mRNA abundance levels of most genes as well as the distribution of the peaks of these profiles fit asymmetric Gaussians. We hypothesize that the asymmetry in the distribution of the peaks of the profiles is due to two competing evolutionary forces. We show that the asymmetry in the profiles of the genes might be due to a previously unknown asymmetry in the gel electrophoresis thermal broadening of a moving, rather than a stationary, band of RNA molecules.},

@article{GIULIANI20171069,
	abstract = {There is a neat distinction between general purpose statistical techniques and quantitative models developed for specific problems. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) blurs this distinction: while being a general purpose statistical technique, it implies a peculiar style of reasoning. PCA is a `hypothesis generating' tool creating a statistical mechanics frame for biological systems modeling without the need for strong a priori theoretical assumptions. This makes PCA of utmost importance for approaching drug discovery by a systemic perspective overcoming too narrow reductionist approaches.},

@article{SASTRY20075275,
	abstract = {The present work integrates the multiscale transform provided by the wavelets and singular value decomposition (SVD) for the detection of anomaly in self-similar network data. The algorithm proposed in this paper uses the properties of singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix whose elements are local energies of wavelet coefficients at different scales. Unlike existing techniques, our method determines both the presence (i.e., the time intervals in which anomaly occurs) and the nature of anomaly (i.e., anomaly of bursty type, long or short duration, etc.) in network data. It uses the diagonal, left and right singular matrices obtained in SVD to determine the number of scales of self-similarity, location and scales of anomaly in data, respectively. Our simulation work on different data sets demonstrates that the method performs better than the existing anomaly detection methods proposed for self-similar data.},

@article{Famili:2003aa,
	abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic networks can be reconstructed. The systemic biochemical properties of these networks can now be studied. Here, genome-scale reconstructed metabolic networks were analysed using singular value decomposition (SVD). All the individual biochemical conversions contained in a reconstructed metabolic network are described by a stoichiometric matrix (S). SVD of S led to the definition of the underlying modes that characterize the overall biochemical conversions that take place in a network and rank-ordered their importance. The modes were shown to correspond to systemic biochemical reactions and they could be used to identify the groups and clusters of individual biochemical reactions that drive them. Comparative analysis of the Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Helicobacter pylori genome-scale metabolic networks showed that the four dominant modes in all three networks correspond to: (1) the conversion of ATP to ADP, (2) redox metabolism of NADP, (3) proton-motive force, and (4) inorganic phosphate metabolism. The sets of individual metabolic reactions deriving these systemic conversions, however, differed among the three organisms. Thus, we can now define systemic metabolic reactions, or eigen-reactions, for the study of systems biology of metabolism and have a basis for comparing the overall properties of genome-specific metabolic networks.},

	abstract = {We describe the use of singular value decomposition in transforming genome-wide expression data from genes x arrays space to reduced diagonalized "eigengenes" x "eigenarrays" space, where the eigengenes (or eigenarrays) are unique orthonormal superpositions of the genes (or arrays). Normalizing the data by filtering out the eigengenes (and eigenarrays) that are inferred to represent noise or experimental artifacts enables meaningful comparison of the expression of different genes across different arrays in different experiments. Sorting the data according to the eigengenes and eigenarrays gives a global picture of the dynamics of gene expression, in which individual genes and arrays appear to be classified into groups of similar regulation and function, or similar cellular state and biological phenotype, respectively. After normalization and sorting, the significant eigengenes and eigenarrays can be associated with observed genome-wide effects of regulators, or with measured samples, in which these regulators are overactive or underactive, respectively.},

@article{Francis-QR-1962,
	abstract = {The QR transformation is an analogue to the LR transformation (Rutishauser, 1958) based on unitary transformations. Both these transformations are global iterative methods for finding the eigenvalues of a matrix, the matrix converging in general to triangular form. In Par t1 of this paper the QR transformation was briefly described and we were then principally concerned with proving convergence, the main result being expressed in theorem 3. We also showed that if the matrix is first reduced to almost triangular form important advantages are gained (further advantages will become apparent) and we gave in outline a way in which convergence could be improved. In this part of the paper we consider the practical application of the QR transformation. Two versions of the algorithm have been programmed for the Pegasus computer; these are described and an attempt is made to evaluate the method. Some results and detailed algorithms are given in appendices. Part 1 was published on pp. 265--71 of this volume (Oct. 61).},

@article{Francis-QR-1961,
	abstract = {The LR transformation, due to Rutishauser, has proved to be a powerful method for finding the eigenvalues of symmetric band matrices. Little attention, however, has been paid to its application to the more difficult problem of finding eigenvalues of general unsymmetric matrices. If the matrices are large two important difficulties are likely to occur. Firstly, triangular decomposition, which is the basis of the method, is by no means always numerically stable, and secondly, the amount of computation required by the method is likely to be very great. This paper describes an algorithm similar to the LR transformation except that the transformations involved in it are all unitary and can thus be expected to by numerically stable. It is then shown that there are various advantages in first converting the matrix to almost-triangular form; in particular, the amount of work involved in the algorithm can then be greatly reduced.Part 1 of the paper is largely concerned with proof of convergence, and the theoretical aspect. Part 2, to be published in January, discussed practical computation and gives results of experiments.},
